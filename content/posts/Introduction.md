# How this post is going to work?
This post intends to bring a review of the course **“Exploiting and Securing Vulnerabilities in Java Applications”** available on Coursera, eventually, I also intend to bring some additional information. The dynamic of the post will be the same as the course, it’ll begin with an explanation about the topic, followed by a practical exercise trying to find the vulnerability, much like a CTF, and finally, explain how to fix it. 

**OBS1**: The only exception to this rule is the fourth week. Due to the content and length, doesn’t make sense to follow this structure.

I don’t think is necessary to teach how to set the environment, since the instructor has a group of videos explaining this step-by-step. The important thing to know is that we’ll be using Webgoat, as said by the creators of the app: “WebGoat is a deliberately insecure application that allows interested developers just like you to test vulnerabilities commonly found in Java-based applications that use common and popular open-source components.”


**OBS2**: Srry! I had to resize images to fit the screen properly and also make the website faster. If the images look a little blurry, what you can do is zoom in or open the image in another tab.

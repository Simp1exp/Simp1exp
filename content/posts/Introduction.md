# How this post is going to work?
The intention of this post is to bring a review of the course **“Exploiting and Securing Vulnerabilities in Java Applications”** available on Coursera, eventually I also intend to bring some insights and some additional information. The dynamic of the post will be the same as the course, it’ll begin with an explanation about the topic, followed by a practical exercise trying to find the vulnerability, much like a CTF, and finally explain how to fix it. I don’t think is necessary to teach how to set the environment, since the instructor have a group of videos explaining this step-by-step. The important thing to know is that we’ll be using Webgoat, as said by the creators of the app: “WebGoat is a deliberately insecure application that allows interested developers just like you to test vulnerabilities commonly found in Java-based applications that use common and popular open-source components.”
